January 25th 2020 marked the first week of CIT 481/L, the second semester for System Design and Implementation. One of the main goals for this class will be to obtain AWS certification. At present, AWS offers eleven certifications: one foundational, three associate-level, two professional-level, and five specialty. The two this class will be focused on this semester are [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - Foundational](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/cloud-academy-cloud-practitioner-certification-preparation-for-aws-180/) and [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/cloud-academy-solutions-architect-associate-certification-v152-184/).

### AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification Learning Objectives

-Describe the AWS Cloud value proposition
<br>
-Describe the AWS Cloud and the AWS global infrastructure
<br>
-Recognize and explain basic AWS Cloud architectural principles
<br>
-Describe key services on the AWS platform and their common use cases
<br>
-Describe basic security and compliance aspects of the AWS platform and the shared security model
<br>
-Define the billing, account management, and pricing models
<br>
-Describe basic/core characteristics of deploying and operating in the AWS Cloud

### AWS Solutions Architect Certification Learning Objectives

-Recognize and explain the core AWS services and applications
<br>
-Determine and define Resilient Architectures
<br>
-Determine and define Performant Architectures
<br>
-Determine and specify how to secure architectures and applications
<br>
-Determine and define cost efficient architectures
<br>
-Determine operationally efficient architectures

### Group Projects

This semester, we will also be working on group projects. Every few weeks each group will present on their current status. Team Aerial, my team, is researching KVM and how to streamline/automate the process of spinning up servers with an xml document. Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a virtualization module in the Linux kernel. It enables the kernel to function as a hypervisor allowing a host machine to run multiple guests or virtual machines (VMs). Every VM is executed as a regular Linux process and is scheduled by the standard Linux scheduler, with dedicated virtual hardware. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language used to encode documents in a way that both humans and machines can read. XML files are plain text files that use custom tags to describe the structure of the document, as well as how it should be stored and transported. Using a tool called virsh, you can create, delete, run, stop, and manage virtual machines from the command line.

The command to install virsh:

    sudo apt-get install libvirt-bin 
    
Our team will first test out KVM using AWS [spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) as the sandbox environment.
