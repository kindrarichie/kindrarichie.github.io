## Blog Post 2



In my previous blog post, I commented that I wanted to find a way to get Apache to start without having to do it manually once the container was already open. A fellow student helped me to understand that I needed to change my server name to localhost and that I was missing a quotation mark in one of my commands. That same student also suggested that I copy the Affinity repo to my own repo so that I can use the clone command (in lieu of COPY) and ensure I have a functioning/stable application. That suggestion actually proved useful in the next lab as you will see.

This week we were given more information about the group project and instructed to email the professor our group project details. I am in a two-member group with a selected name of Aerial. For project management we will be using JIRA. 

We were also assigned Lab 2 Ansible Playbooks. Using Docker, I created two ansible playbooks. I consulted the Ansible Documentation and Stack Overflow to get tips on how to write the playbooks. Playbooks are composed of one or more plays in a list. Plays map a group of hosts to roles, represented by tasks. A task is a call to an ansible module.

For the first playbook we had to install traceroute, create a copy of /etc/sudoers file for backup, install sudo inside our containers if using Docker which I was, create a group named admins, create a group named cit480, add 2 users to each group, give the admins group sudo powers, and give cit480 group sudo access to run traceroute. 

A useful tool I learned when writing this playbook was to use a loop. One of the loops in my tasks was:

    - name: Create group admins and cit480
      group:
        name: "{{ item }}" 
        state: present
      loop:
        - admins
        - cit480

This proved a slightly more efficient way of creating my two requisite groups.

For the second playbook we had to use the instructions from Lab 1 to create an Ansible playbook to install a LAMP Stack. For the portion from Lab 1 where we had to change the document root and edit the apache.conf file, I had previously just copied the amended files from my local directory. The updated solution for me in this lab was to upload the amended files to GitHub and clone them. For example:

    - name: Clone repo document root
      git:
        repo: https://github.com/kindrarichie/ChangeDocumentRoot.git
        dest: /tmp/000-default.conf

This Lab was more challenging but I was very happy to begin learning Ansible. I think it would be nice to compare the code other students wrote to get a better idea of all possible solutions.
