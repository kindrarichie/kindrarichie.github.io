## Blog Post 3

In class on Saturday, February 29 2020, the first group project presentations are due. Presentations should cover goals, tools used/using, steps taken to get everything set up, and what we have done so far. Our particular group will be installing a Confluence server. We will need to use a VPN for our project as we will be accessing CSUN infrastructure. CSUN no longer uses Pulse, but instead GlobalProtect for a VPN. 

I had to install the GlobalProtect mac client. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/vpn-global-protect-mac-020320.pdf). After downloading GlobalProtect from the CSUN Software Downloads page, I ran into an installation issue. MacOS Mojave requires that you accept 3rd party kernel extensions. This can be done under System Preferences and Security. As it was time to update my mac's OS, I went ahead and updated to Catalina which resolved the issue. 

My group's project, in a continuation from the prior semester, will deploy Confluence and a database to two VMs provided by the professor. Confluence is a collaboration tool created by Australian software company Atlassian. It is a knowledge management system that helps teams to create, organize, share, and discuss their work. Our project tasks so far inlcude: provisioning the GitHub repository, creating an infrastructure diagram, verifying server requirements for Confluence are met, test Confluence using wiki.sandbox.csun.edu, installing PostgreSQL 10.0 on the database server vm, creating a database user and database, installing Confluence 7.3 on the Linux application server vm, connecting the database server to the application server, configuring Apache to front Tomcat with reverse proxy, setting up the Apache Web Server, connecting Apache to Confluence using mod_Proxy, securing Confluence with Apache using TLS, PostgreSQL database backup using a Cron task, documenting Confluence application server deployment, and documenting PostgreSQL database server deployment.

### AWS Academy  Cloud Foundations Module 2: Cloud Economics and Billing

#### Topics

-**Fundamentals of Pricing**. Three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS. (1) Compute: Charged per hour/second, varies by instance type. (2) Storage: Charged typically per GB. (3) Data transfer: Outbound is aggregated and charged, inbound has no charge with some exceptions, charged typically per GB. How do you pay for AWS: Pay for what you use (pay only for the services you consume with no large up front expenses), pay less when you reserve, pay less when you use more (volume based discounts, tiered pricing for some services, many storage services deliver lower costs based on needs), and as AWS grows (economies of scale). Custom pricing: meet varying needs, available for high volume projects with unique requirements. AWS free tier (1 year for new customers) : enables free hands on experience with the AWS platform, products, and services. Services with no charge: Amazon VPC, Elastic Beanstalk, Auto Scaling, AWS OpsWorks, AWS CloudFormation, AWS IAM, and Consolidated Billing. For certain services like Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS, you can invest in reserved capacity. Reserved Instances are available in 3 options â€“ All up-front (AURI), partial up-front (PURI) or no upfront payments (NURI).
<br>
<br>
-**Total Cost of Ownership**. The difference between on-premises and cloud is in how they are deployed. Traditional infrastructure (equipment, resources and administration, contracts, capital cost). AWS Cloud (no upfront expense, improve market and agility, scale up and down, self service infrastructure). Identify the best option by comparing the physical solution to the cloud soultion. Total cost of ownership, financial estimate to help id direct and indirect costs of a system. TCO is useful to compare costs of running an entire infrastructure enviroment or specific workload on premises vs AWS. It can help to build the business case for moving to the cloud. TCO considerations: server costs, storage costs, network costs, IT labor costs. There is a TCO calculator. You can use the AWS Simple Monthly calcutor pricing tool to estimate monthly costs, id opportunities to reduce monthly costs, and use templates to compare services and deployment models. 
<br>
<br>
-**Delaware North Case Study**. Case study on TCO. Leader in food service and hospitality industry. $3 billion in annual revenue. On-premise data center was becoming too unwieldy. They conducted a test wherein they moved their on-premise data center to AWS. They used 3 year Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances. Evaluation had 3 criteria: a cloud solution needed a broad set of technologies that could handle the enterprise workloads and deliver support for critical functions, for operations flexibilty was needed to modify core IT processes to improve efficiencies and lower costs, financial requirements needed to show an ROI for moving away from exiting infrastructure. Cost comparison showed a $3.5 savings for a 5 year run rate. The result was resource optimization, speed to market, and operational efficiency. Operated with greater speed and agility.    
<br>
-**AWS Organizations**. With larger organizations it can sometimes make more sense to have separate AWS accounts to each department. This makes the expenses clear. A service is needed to tie the separate account together. This is AWS Organizations. It is a free account management service enabling consolidation of multiple AWS accounts into an organizational tree. It allows for consolidated billing and organization security management capabilities. A basic organization is called a root. It consists of accounts which are organized into organizational units (OU's) which are branches for accounts. Branches can contain other branches. The heirarchy is like an upside-down tree with the root at the top. A branch can only have one parent. Each account can be a member of exactly one branch. Service control policies allow/deny acces to AWS services for individual/group accounts in an OU. Organizations setup: (1) create organization (2) create organizational units (3) create service control polices (4) test restrictions. AWS Organizations can be managed through different interfaces (Console, CLI, SDKs, ATTPS Query API).
<br>
-**AWS Billing & Cost Management**. A service used to pay your AWS bill, monitor your usage, and budget your expenses. Allows a better idea of future costs and usage. Allows custom time period and monthly or daily granulairty. Filtering and grouping function to analyze data using a variety of dimensions. The AWS Cost and Usage Report Tool ids chances for optimization. The AWS Billing Dashboard allows viewing month-to-date expenses and identifying services that account for majority of your monthyly bill. Also, understand how costs are trending. Other Dashboard tools to estimate and plan AWS expenses: AWS Budget, AWS Cost and Usage Report, AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Bills page (costs over the past month for each service - breakdown by region and linked account).
<br>
-**AWS Technical Support Models**. Provide unique combination of tools and expertise: AWS Support, AWS Support Plans. Support is provided for: Experimenting with AWS, Production use of AWS, Business-critical use of AWS. Proactive guidance: Technical Account Manager (TAM, primary point of contact, informed when planning and deploying solutions, Enterpise Support Plan). Best practices: AWS Trusted Advisor (automated service acting like a customized cloud expert, opportunities to reduce monthly expenditures and increase productivity, what you are doing right, what needs to be corrected, use as much as possilbe during implementation to make sure things are done right the first time). Account assistance: AWS Support Concierge (billing and account expert - non technical billing and account level inquiries). AWS Support has four plans: Basic (Resource Center acces, Serivce Health Dashboard, product FAQs, discussion forums, support for health checks). Developer Support(Support for early development on AWS). Business Support (Customers that run production workloads). Enterprise Support (Customers that run business and mission-critical workloads). Case severity levels: Critical (business is at risk), Urgent (business significantly impacted), High (import functions of application impaired or degraded), Normal (non-critical functions are behaving abnormally or time sensitive development question), Low (general development questiom or you want to request a feature).
