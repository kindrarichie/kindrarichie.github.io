This week we were assigned Lab 1 LAMP Stack.  The objectives of this lab were to learn new docker commands, familiarize ourselves with the package manager apt-get, and become more comfortable using the CLI.

Firstly, we went through the steps of creating a Docker container with a LAMP stack. A LAMP stack is an open-source Web development platform. It is short for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. That process started by creating a new container and then updating the package repository.

The command we used to create a new container is:

    docker run -it -p 8080:80 --name lab1 ubuntu:latest bash 
    
Docker run, runs the command in a new container. -it, provides an interactive terminal. -p, maps the local port 8080 to port 80 in the container. –name, will give the container the name lab1. ubuntu:latest, is the image that will be used. bash, run the bash command when building the container. 
    
The command used to update the package repository is:
    
    apt-get update && apt-get upgrade 
    
Apt-get is a package manager. Apt-get update updates the list of packages are in Ubuntu’s repositories. It must be run before upgrading to get an updated list of packages. 
    
Finally, the ultimate task was to take what we had just learned and create a Docker base image with the aforementioned software. I had three major issues with getting my LAMP stack and application to run. One issue I ran in to when building the Dockerfile I had written was that I kept getting the error:
    
    git: 'clone' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
    
This was in reference to the instruction:
    
    RUN git clone https://github.com/csuntechlab/affinity.git
    
After looking at the Docker forums, I learned that the resolution to this error was to copy the data into the Docker image. It also seems that this is a better practice for production to ensure a working image. 
    
The second issue I had concerning the Dockerfile was installing composer. I kept getting the error:
    
    Composer could not find a composer.json file in /
    To initialize a project, please create a composer.json file as described in the https://getcomposer.org/ "Getting Started" section
    
After reviewing Docker Best Practices, I realized that my command:
    
    RUN cd /var/www/html/affinity
    
Would be best expressed as:
    
    WORKDIR /var/www/html/affinity
    
My third issue concerned getting Apache to restart within the Docker container. I have yet to figure out how to address this. The professor affirmed that the Dockerfile would be okay to submit without this feature, but I hope to discover in the future if and how this can be accomplished. 
    
As we learn more commands, I am including them in a document for my own review. In my spare time I am trying to practice my newly learned commands and review Docker as well as GitHub notes so that I will become more proficient.
