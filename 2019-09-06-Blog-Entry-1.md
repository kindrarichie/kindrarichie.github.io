## Blog Post 1



The inaugural class meeting for CIT 480/L was 08/24/2019. The professor gave an overview of the tools we will be learning and utilizing this semester. I am excited to develop new skills that will serve me now and in my future endeavors. I am particularly keen to learn more about Docker as PaaS and Cloud Computing in general have become standard for business. 
The first week’s class assignments were to complete Lab A and to create a blog. I first dove in to creating my blog as I thought this would be the more difficult task for this week. 

I selected Jekyll as my static site generator. A static site generator allows for the building of static HTML webpages using templates. They improve performance and simplify server side setup. To guide me I used the tutorial [“How to Start a Jekyll Blog on GitHub Pages for Free”](https://onextrapixel.com/start-jekyll-blog-github-pages-free/) created by Anna Monus. I already had a GitHub account but decided to switch my username to my actual name to make the blog match the standard I saw the professor use and to make it more readily identifiable. Next, I created a new repository for the online version of the blog. Again, when naming the new repository, I followed GitHub standards. The local copy of the site will be on my computer. I needed Jekyll, a Ruby gem, to be on my computer and installing it was the next step. I already had Ruby and RubyGems up and running on my computer, so went straight to installing Jekyll by using the command:

    sudo gem install jekyll  

To determine if Jekyll was functioning correctly, I issued the command:

    jekyll -v

The version number was returned so I knew that all was well. 

Next, I needed to actually create the Jekyll site. In the interest of keeping my blog streamlined and minimal, I decided to use an existing Jekyll theme that I cloned from GitHub called slate. Of note, to ensure the theme change worked I updateded the the \_config.yml and index.md files, added the theme as a Gem to the Gemfile, and installed the theme using Bundler. A useful command I learned during the site creation process was:

    jekyll serve –watch

It can be used to access the local copy of my blog on the localhost:4000 URL.

To add blog posts, you create a new file. The filenames use the following naming convention:

    year-month-date-{slug}.md

Once I was done writing my blog post, I pushed my new site live.

After getting my blog up and running, I set to work completing the lab. First, I made sure that I had an SSH environment on my computer and access to ssh.sandbox.edu. I confirmed that I did and then moved on to installing Docker. I selected option 3 from the lab to install Docker on a Windows 10 Operating System. One command that I learned stuck out from the rest. It was:

    docker pull

The command caught my attention because it reminded me of the pull command invoked when using GitHub. Here, it pulls an image from the Docker community's repository. 

There were two main issues that I ran in to when completing the lab. First, I incorrectly wrote the scp command by substituting my UID for that of the person's directory that I would be copying a file from. Second, I initially  did not understand  how to answer the lab questions. It escaped me that the questions were part of an interactive script. After overcoming my initial confusion, I was able to complete the lab report and submit it to the platform Canvas.

The week was fun and a bit challenging as I had never before created a Jekyll website on GitHub. I look forward to the coming week's tasks.
