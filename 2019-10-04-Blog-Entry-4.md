## Blog Post 4



This week we assigned our first project. The professor instructed that instead of using JIRA for project management, we will be using GitHub as it has some built in functionality to have tasks done. This first assignment is more focused on documentation rather than coding. The documentation will have to be pushed to a brand new public repository. 

Create a new public repository on GitHub utilizing the command line API as follows: 

    curl -u 'USER' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"REPO"}'
    
Replace USER with your username and REPO with your repository name.

To setup the new repo use the following commands: 

    touch README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin git@github.com:username/<reponame>.git
    
To push changes to the repo use the following command:

    git push -u origin master
    

Each team will create a project for the repository that is setup. The template is basic kanban. This will give us three columns: to do, in progress, and done. Before moving tasks to the done column, we must make sure a pull request is done by a different person on the team to ensure the task is in fact done. The project is due 10/12/2019. Each team will give a presentation wherein they give an overview of the project and demo it.
