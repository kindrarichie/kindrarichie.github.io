## Blog Post 12



This week, the final week of the semester for CIT 480, we worked on Project 2. My team has elected to install Confluence on a virtual machine that will be provided by the professor. Confluence is a collaboration tool created by Australian software company Atlassian. It helps teams to create, organize, share, and discuss their work. It features a rich text editor for the creation of blogs, meeting notes, project plans, and documentation. Flexible deployment options include either cloud or self-managed. Our team will be using the self-managed option. This will allow us to host Confluence on CSUN infrastructure and customize setup. Fairly thorough instructions provided by Atlassian can be found [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-installation-guide-135681.html). 

Due to end of semester time contraints, this last week our team has focused on outlining the steps needed to install Confluence and a presentation providing our project status. 

The tasks for Project 2 are to:

-Provision the GitHub repository.
&nbsp;  
-Create a PowerPoint presentation.
&nbsp;  
-Verify server requirements for Confluence are met.
&nbsp;  
-Document Confluence application server deployment.
&nbsp;  
-Document PostgreSQL database server deployment.
&nbsp;
-Install PostgreSQL 9.6 on database server.
&nbsp;  
-Create database user and database.
&nbsp;  
-Install Confluence 7.1 on Linux application server.
&nbsp;  
-Connect database server to application server. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;

A database is required to run Confluence. During Confluence evaluation, you can use the embedded database included in the Confluence installation. When moving to a production installation, you must set up an external database server. Atlassian recommends using PostgreSQL. 

For Project 3 the professor will provide us with two virtual machines. One virtual machine will have the Confluence application installed. The other will have the PostgreSQL database installed.

The following is a continuation of what I am learning about CISCO networking.

### Router Switching Function

The main function of a router is to forward packets toward their destination. This is done by using a switching function. It is the process used by a router to accept a packet on one interface and forward it out of another interface. It is important to remember that packets must be placed in the appropriate data link frame type for the outgoing data link.
 
&nbsp;

#### Three major steps:

•    De-encapsulate the Layer 2 frame header and trailer to expose the Layer 3 packet. 

•    Examine the destination IP address of the IP packet to find the best path in the routing table.

•    If the router finds a path to the destination, it encapsulates the Layer 3 packet into a new Layer 2 frame and forwards the frame out the exit interface.


Devices have Layer 3 IPv4 addresses and Ethernet interfaces have Layer 2 data link addresses. As a packet travels from the source to the final destination, the Layer 3 IP addresses do not change. However, the Layer 2 data link addresses change at every hop as the packet is de-encapsulated and re-encapsulated in a new Layer 2 frame by each router.
