## Blog Post 7



This week we were assigned Project 1. For Project 1 we are redoing much of the work performed during Project 0 but in a more production worthy way. We will be using automation techniques to build the AWS environment, set up the web server, and deploying our code.

For this project, I am trading roles with my teammate and I will be the project leader. 

The software tools we will be using to accomplish this project are:

-Ansible
-Terraform
-AWS CLI

In working with Terraform, the state of changes to the infrastructure can be tracked over time. We will be using a remote backend, AWS Simple Storage Service (S3), to track changes instead of local files. When working on a team, it is better to store the state file remotely so that more people can access it to make changes to the infrastructure. S3 will allows the team to track state overtime without worrying about one person overwriting the work of another. We will also use AWS DynamoDB to lock changes from happening from multiple people at the same time. 

First, I downloaded Terraform. Next, in a new local directory I created a terraform file, main.tf, containing: 

    provider "aws" {
    version = "~> 2.33"
    region = "us-west-2"
    shared_credentials_file = ~/.aws/credentials"
    profile = "default"
    } 

Then, I ran terraform init to initialize the working directory that will contain Terraform configuration files. Next, I created the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table by adding the following to the main.tf file:

    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tf-remote-state" {
    bucket = "name of bucket to create"
    versioning {
     enabled = true
     }
    lifecycle {
      prevent_destroy = true
     }
    }
    resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "dynamodb-tf-state-lock" {
    name            = "name of table to create" 
    hash_key        = "LockID"
    read_capacity   = 20
    write_capacity = 20
     attribute {
     name = "LockID"
     type = "S"
    }
     tags {
      Name = "DynamoDB tf state locking"
      }
    }

I then ran: 
    $ terraform plan 
to see what the expected outcome would be. Then I ran:
    $ terraform apply
to apply the changes. 

After creating the bucket and table, I added to the top of the main.tf file:

    terraform {
      backend  "s3" {
      region         = "us-west-2"
      bucket         = "the name of the bucket you created"
      key            = terraform.tfstate" 
      dynamodb_table = "the name of the table you created"
      }
    }
to establish the Terraform backend. 

For the rest of the week I will be working on the Terraform tasks of creating:   

-IAM
-VPC
-Service infrastructure
