## Blog Post 3

In class on Saturday, February 14 2020, the professor lectured on AWS VPC's. VPC's (Virtual Private Clouds) are virtual networks specific to yourself that hold your AWS services. VPC's have their own route tables, network access control lists (ACL), subnets and security groups.  

-Each subnet will exist within one availability zone. 
<br>
-While security groups are stateful, ACL's are stateless.
<br>
-VPC's are allowed to be peered within the same account and also across AWS accounts.

While in class, students were shown how to access the AWS training and certification curriculum modules for Cloud Foundations as well as the associated Vocareum labs. 

### AWS Academy  Cloud Foundations Module 1: Cloud Concepts Overview

#### Topics

-**Introduction to cloud computing**. Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Allows you to think of infrastructure as software. Allows flexibility and cost savings. Three main cloud service models: infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. Infrastructure as a service: basic building blocks for your cloud information technology, offering the highest level of flexibility and control. Platform as a service: removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure. Software as a service: a complete product managed by the service provider. Three main cloud computing deployment models: cloud, hybrid, and on-premises (private cloud). Cloud: an application fully deployed in the cloud. Hybrid: to deploy your existing infrastructure and applications to cloud-based resources. On-premises: using virtualization and resource management tools. It is often used to provide dedicated resources. 
<br>
<br>
-**Advantages of cloud computing**. Six advantages: trade capital expense for variable expense, massive economies of scale, stop guessing capacity, increase speed and agility, stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers, go global in minutes.
<br>
<br>
-**Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. Web services are software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized format (e.g. XML, JSON) for the request and response of an API (application programming interface) interaction. It is not tied to an OS or the development language. It is self describing and discoverable. Billing for AWS services becomes operational instead of capital (pay for what you use when you use it). There are categories of services and services can daisy chain. There are three major ways to access AWS services: AWS Management Console (GUI), Command Line Interface (way of scripting interaction), Software Development Kits (easier to use AWS in existing applications. deploy and monitor complex systems all through code).   
<br>
-**AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)**. Moving to the AWS Cloud. Cloud adoption does not happen instantly for many organizations. People, processes, and technology must be in alignment. Fundamental changes must be considered and discussed. Stakeholders must support the new changes. CAF is a document that helps organizations design and go down an accelerate path to successful cloud adoption. CAF provides guidance and best practices. It is organized into six perspectives. Perspectives consist of sets of capabilites. Capabilities identify which areas of an organization require attention. Six perspectives: Business, People, and Governance focus on business capabilites while Platform, Security, and Operations focus on technical capabilities. Business: IT must be aligned with business needs and IT investments must be traceable to demonstrate business results. People: prioritize training, staffing, and organizational changes to build an agile organization. Governance: Skills and processes must align IT strategy and goals with business strategy and goals. Platform: Understand and communicate the nature of IT systems and their relationships. Describe the architecture of the target state environment. Security: Ensure the organization meets its security objectives. Operations: Define how day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year business will be conducted. 

#### Objectives

-Define different types of cloud computing models
<br>
-Describe six advantages of cloud computing
<br>
