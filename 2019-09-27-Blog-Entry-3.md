## Blog Post 3



This week we moved on to Lab 4 Prometheus. The overarching purpose of this lab is for everyone to get a better handle on the command line interface. More specifically, we were instructed to build a docker container, install wget, install Prometheus, and install Node Exporter. 

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system. It is used extensively to monitor containers and microservices. Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics.

As in previous labs, we first needed to spin up a Docker container for an environment in which to install and run Prometheus. In the course of completing this lab, I also learned how to create a new Docker image from an existing container. The command is:

    docker commit runningContainerName imageName:tag

When executing the docker commit command, we must provide two parameters: the name of the running container and the name of our desired image output.

To configure the Prometheus server to access Node Exporter metrics we modify the Scrape_configs: block in the prometheus.yml file.

    Scrape_configs:
    -    Job_name: ‘node’
         static_configs:
    -    Targets: [‘localhost:9100’]

After installing both Prometheus and Node Exporter, I started Node Exporter in the background and Prometheus in the foreground. Finally, I was able to access Prometheus's built-in expression browser by navigating to http://localhost:9090/graph to view available metrics.

This week’s lab was more straightforward. It also provided me much needed time to review and focus on alternate class learning objectives like AWS.
