## Blog Post 2

On Saturday, February 08 2020, the professor covered AWS Cloud Compute Services, Amazon EC2 pricing, and storage.

### AWS Compute Services

Amazon's stated goal is "to be the compute platform for the world." Just a few of the [Compute Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/compute-services.html#aws-lambda) offered by AWS are:

-Amazon EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud), secure and scalable compute capacity.
<br>
-Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, deploy and scale containerized applications.
<br>
-Amazon Lambda, run code without the administration. 

### Amazon EC2 pricing

There are five ways to [pay](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) for Amazon EC2 instances

-On-Demand, low cost and flexibility with no up-front payment or long standing commitment.
<br>
-Spot instances, request and use spare EC2 computing capacity at a discount. 
<br>
-Savings Plans, flexible and low prices on EC2 and Fargate with a commitment to consistent usage.
<br>
-Reserved Instances, large discount for applications with steady state usage. 
<br>
-Dedicated Hosts, a physical EC2 server dedicated for your use.

### AWS Cloud Storage Products

There are [three main types](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-storage/#types) of cloud data storage: object storage, file storage, and block storage. AWS offers a [spectrum of cloud storage services](https://aws.amazon.com/products/storage/) from these three types. These include but are not limited to:

-Amazon EBS (Amazon Elastic Block Store), persistent local storage.
<br>
-Amazon EFS (Amazon Elastic File System), scalable and elastic file system for Linux-based workloads.
<br>
-AWS Backup, fully managed backup service.


After class we were assigned AWS Lab 1. Lab 1 is designed to help improve our knowledge of
EC2, EBS, IAM and S3.

The tasks included: 

-Creating a S3 bucket.
<br>
-[Creating an IAM Role enabling S3 access from an EC2 instance](https://cloud-gc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter03_advanced-tutorial/iam-role.html#create-a-new-iam-role).
<br>
-Creating an EC2 instance and [attaching the IAM access role](https://cloud-gc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter03_advanced-tutorial/iam-role.html#assign-that-role-to-ec2).
<br>
-[Creating and attaching an 8G EBS volume to the EC2 instance. Format and mount the file system. Modify fstab so that the EBS automounts on reboot](https://devopscube.com/mount-ebs-volume-ec2-instance/).
<br>
-Running the command

    aws s3 cp 
    
to copy a file from the EC2 instance to the S3 bucket.
