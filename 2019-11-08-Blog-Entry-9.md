## Blog Post 9



Most of the tasks for [Project 1](https://github.com/alexcoward/Project1Infrastructure) have been completed by my team. Left is project documentation and installing Fail2ban on the bastion host created last week as part of the Terraform EC2 configuration.
To prevent brute force attacks, I created an Ansible playbook that installs Fail2ban on the bastion. I discovered a GitHub [repo](https://gist.github.com/5car1z/76dd1e48f9b16dbd2fb370bba1e2d393) that does exactly that. It will send email alerts if Fail2ban is triggered.

After cloning the repo I only had to make a few changes.

-Create an ansible.cfg file 

    [defaults]
    inventory = ./inventory
    host_key_checking = false

    [privilege_escalation]
    become = true
    become_method = sudo
    become_user = root
    become_ask_pass = false


-Create an inventory file with an entry for the bastion

-Adjust the email settings for destemail, sendername, and sender in the jail.local file. 

    [DEFAULT]

    # email address to receive notifications.
    destemail = root@localhost
    # the email address from which to send emails.
    sender = root@<fq-hostname>
    # name on the notification emails.
    sendername = Fail2Ban
    # email transfer agent to use.
    mta = sendmail

    # see action.d/ufw.conf
    actionban = ufw.conf
    # see action.d/ufw.conf
    actionunban = ufw.conf

    [sshd]
    enabled = true
    port = ssh
    filter = sshd
    # the length of time between login attempts for maxretry.
    findtime = 600
    # attempts from a single ip before a ban is imposed.
    maxretry = 5
    # the number of seconds that a host is banned for.
    bantime = 3600

I ran the playbook locally: 

    $ ansible-playbook fail2ban-plyabook.yml

Finally, I verified that Fail2ban was installed and running:

    $ service fail2ban status
