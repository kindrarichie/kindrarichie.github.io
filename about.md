I am a senior at California State University Northridge. Weekly I will post to this blog using my GitHub account for classes CIT 480/L System Design and Implementation I and CIT 481/L System Design and Implementation II. Each post will be generated using the command-line tool provided by Jekyll. The blog entries will detail a task that I performed during the week.
