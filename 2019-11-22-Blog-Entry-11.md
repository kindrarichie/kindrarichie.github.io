## Blog Post 11



This week we began to flesh out the particulars for what will be Project 2. The professor provided the following options for the groups to choose from:

1. Create Lambda functions for use with spot instances.
2. Create Ansilbe playbooks for server configurations.
3. Create ECS cluster to host applications.

4. Update existing infrastructure.
5. Create a new infrastructure setup to host a new application/server.In addition, students were advised that they could try to pursue their own ideas provided the professor gives approval. My group is thinking of working with JIRA and Confluence. We are unsure, however, if JIRA would be hosted within AWS or CSUN.

As a continuation from last week, I also spent some time learning about CISCO networking. What follows is more of what I was able to absorb.

### NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS

•    Topology - There are physical and logical topologies. The physical topology is the arrangement of the cables, network devices, and end systems. The logical topology is the path over which the data is transferred in a network. 

•    Speed - Speed is a measure of the data rate in bits per second (b/s) of a given link in the network.

•    Security - Security indicates how protected the network is, including the information that is transmitted over the network. 

•    Availability - Availability is the likelihood that the network is available for use when it is required.

•    Scalability - Scalability indicates how easily the network can accommodate more users and data transmission requirements. 

•    Reliability - Reliability indicates the dependability of the components that make up the network, such as the routers, switches, PCs, and servers.

Communication between networks would not be possible without a router determining the best path to the destination and forwarding traffic to the next router along that path. The router routes traffic between networks.

The primary functions of a router are to:

•    Determine the best path to send packets

•    Forward packets toward their destination

The router uses its routing table to determine the best path to use to forward a packet. When the router receives a packet, it examines the destination address of the packet and uses the routing table to search for the best path to that network.

Routers support three packet-forwarding mechanisms:

•    Process switching - An older packet forwarding mechanism. When a packet arrives on an interface, it is forwarded to the control plane where the CPU matches the destination address with an entry in its routing table, and then determines the exit interface and forwards the packet. The router does this for every packet, even if the destination is the same for a stream of packets. This mechanism is very slow and rarely implemented now.

•    Fast switching - This mechanism uses a fast-switching cache to store next-hop information. When a packet arrives on an interface, it is forwarded to the control plane where the CPU searches for a match in the fast-switching cache. If it is not there, it is process-switched and forwarded to the exit interface. The flow information for the packet is also stored in the fast-switching cache.

•    Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) - CEF is the most recent and preferred Cisco IOS packet-forwarding mechanism. It builds a Forwarding Information Base (FIB), and an adjacency table. However, the table entries are not packet-triggered like fast switching but change-triggered such as when something changes in the network topology. When a network has converged, the FIB and adjacency tables contain all the information a router would have to consider when forwarding a packet.
