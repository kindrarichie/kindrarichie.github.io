## Blog Post 11



This week we began to flesh out the particulars for what will be Project Two. The professor provided the following options for the group to choose from: 

1. Create Lambda functions for use with spot instances.
2. Create Ansible playbooks for server configurations.
3. Create an ECS cluster to host applications.
4. Update existing infrastructure.
5. Create a new infrastructure setup to host a new application/server.

In addition, students were advised

-IAM (users, groups, policies, etc)

-VPC (subnets, route tables, Internet Gateways, NAT instances, etc)

-EC2 (Application Load Balancers (ALB), web server instances, etc)

I focused the bulk of my energy on having Terraform setup EC2. First in my main.tf file for EC2, I used the terraform block described in last week's blog post

    terraform {
      backend  "s3" {
      region         = "us-west-2"
      bucket         = "the name of the bucket you created"
      key            = terraform.tfstate" 
      dynamodb_table = "the name of the table you created"
      }
    }    

and added it to the top of my file. I made sure to change the key.  

Next, I created the web server instances using the code : 

    resource "aws_instance" "Webserver1" {
     ami                    = "${var.AMIIDB}"
     instance_type          = "t2.micro"
     key_name               = "${var.Key_pair}"
     subnet_id              = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.subnet-pvt2
     vpc_security_group_ids = ["${aws_security_group.server_sg.id}"]
     tags = {
      Name = "Webserver1"
      tag-key = "project-project1"
     }
    user_data = <<EOF
    #! /bin/bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y ec2-instance-connect
    sudo apt-get install -y apache2
    sudo systemctl start apache2
    sudo systemctl enable apache2
    echo "<h1>Deployed via Terraform Server 1</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
    EOF
     root_block_device {
     volume_type = "gp2"
     volume_size = "30"
     }
    } 
    
I then created a security group for my web server instances. Next, I created a bastion of jump (with it's security group) instance to provide secure access to the web server instances that will be located in the private subnets of my VPC.

To create my ALB and its security group I used the code:

    resource "aws_alb" "web_elb" {
     name                       = "web-alb"
     internal                   = false
     security_groups            = ["${aws_security_group.server_sg.id}"]
     subnets                    = [data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.subnet-pub1, data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.subnet-pub2, data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.subnet-pub3]
     enable_deletion_protection = false
    }
    
After that I had to configure a target group. It is used as the target group in the default listener rule, which forwards requests to the target group.

Then I created web server listeners for port 443 and 80 to 443 for redirect. I offloaded the task of ssl/tls to the ALB.

    resource "aws_alb_listener" "ws_listener_http" {
     load_balancer_arn = "${aws_alb.web_elb.arn}"
     port              = "80"
     protocol          = "HTTP"

     default_action {
       type = "redirect"

       redirect {
        port        = "443"
        protocol    = "HTTPS"
        status_code = "HTTP_301"
      }
     }
    }

    resource "aws_alb_listener" "ws_alb_https" {
     load_balancer_arn = "${aws_alb.web_elb.arn}"
     port              = "443"
     protocol          = "HTTPS"
     ssl_policy        = "ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08"
     certificate_arn   = "${var.ssl_certificate_id}"

     default_action {
       target_group_arn = "${aws_alb_target_group.alb_ws_tgrp.arn}"
       type             = "forward"
     }
    }
    
After this, I attached my web servers to my ALB. 

Finally, I implemented Route53 using:
    
    
    data "aws_route53_zone" "primary" {
     name = "${var.domain}"
    }
  
    resource "aws_route53_record" "www" {
     zone_id = "${data.aws_route53_zone.primary.zone_id}"
     name    = "www"
     type    = "A"

     alias {
      name                   = "${aws_alb.web_elb.dns_name}"
      zone_id                = "${aws_alb.web_elb.zone_id}"
      evaluate_target_health = true
     }
    }
