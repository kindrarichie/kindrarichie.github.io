## Blog Post 1

This week the AWS classes are being readied for student use. While that is underway, I have develved into further KVM research.

### KVM Overview

If using Linux, you don’t need VirtualBox or VMware to create virtual machines. You can use KVM
to run both Windows and Linux in virtual machines. KVM is open source software. KVM
(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux containing virtualization
extensions. It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko. KVM.ko provides the core
virtualization infrastructure. It also consits of a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or
kvm-amd.ko. With KVM, multiple virtual machines can be run using unmodified Linux or Windows
images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware. The kernel component of KVM is
included in Linux, as of 2.6.20.

KVM can be used directly or with other command-line tools. The graphical Virtual Machine
Manager (Virt-Manager) application may feel more user friendly to those that have used other
virtual machine programs. The Virtual Machine Manager application (virt-manager for short) is a
desktop user interface for managing virtual machines through libvirt. It primarily targets KVM
VMs, but also manages Xen and LXC (linux containers). It allows users to:

-create, edit, start and stop VMs
<br>
-view and control each VM's console
<br>
-see performance and utilization statistics for each VM
<br>
-view all running VMs and hosts, and their live performance or resource utilization statistics
<br>

KVM currently supports savevm/loadvm and offline or live migration. The migrated VM will
continue to run on the destination host. You can migrate a guest between an AMD host to an Intel
host and back. A 64-bit guest can only be migrated to a 64-bit host, but a 32-bit guest can be
migrated at will.

### KVM Ubuntu Installation 

To run KVM, you need a processor that supports hardware virtualization. To determine whether your CPU includes this, review the output from this command

    egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
    
A 0 indicates that your CPU doesn’t support hardware virtualization, while a 1 or more indicates
that it does. Hardware virtualization support may still have to be enabled  in your computer’s
BIOS, even if this command returns a 1 or more.

Use the following command to install KVM and supporting packages

    sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin bridge-utils virt-manager
    
Only the root user and users in the libvirtd group have permission to use KVM virtual machines.
The following command adds your user account to the libvirtd group

    sudo adduser name libvirtd
    
Log out and log back in so that your user becomes an effective member of the libvirtd group. Run
the following command after logging back in to see an empty list of virtual machines. This
indicates that everything is working correctly.

    virsh -c qemu:///system list
    
OR

    virsh list --all
