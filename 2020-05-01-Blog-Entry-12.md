### AWS Module 10: Auto Scaling and Monitoring


<br>


#### Topics

-**Elastic Load Balancing** 
<br>
Elastic Load Balancing is an AWS service that distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets—such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, containers, internet protocol (IP) addresses, and Lambda functions—in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer as traffic to your application changes over time. It can automatically scale to most workloads.

 Elastic Load Balancing is available in three types:
 <br>
 <br>
• An Application Load Balancer operates at the application level (Open Systems Interconnection, or OSI, model layer 7). It routes traffic to targets—Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, containers, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and Lambda functions—based on the content of the request. It is ideal for advanced load balancing of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Secure HTTP (HTTPS) traffic. An Application Load Balancer provides advanced request routing that is targeted at delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and container-based applications. An Application Load Balancer simplifies and improves the security of your application by ensuring that the latest Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) ciphers and protocols are used at all times.
<br>
• A Network Load Balancer operates at the network transport level (OSI model layer 4), routing connections to targets—EC2 instances, microservices, and containers—based on IP protocol data. It works well for load balancing both Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic. A Network Load Balancer is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. A Network Load Balancer is optimized to handle sudden and volatile network traffic patterns.
<br>
• A Classic Load Balancer provides basic load balancing across multiple EC2 instances, and it operates at both the application level and network transport level. A Classic Load Balancer supports the load balancing of applications that use HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL. The Classic Load Balancer is an older implementation. When possible, AWS recommends that you use a dedicated Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer.

A load balancer accepts incoming traffic from clients and routes requests to its registered targets (such as EC2 instances) in one or more Availability Zones. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners. A listener is a process that checks for connection requests. It is configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load balancer. Similarly, it is configured with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the targets. You can also configure your load balancer to perform health checks, which are used to monitor the health of the registered targets so that the load balancer only sends requests to the healthy instances. When the load balancer detects an unhealthy target, it stops routing traffic to that target. It then resumes routing traffic to that target when it detects that the target is healthy again. There is a key difference in how the load balancer types are configured. With Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, you register targets in target groups, and route traffic to the target groups. With Classic Load Balancers, you register instances with the load balancer.

There are many reasons to use a load balancer: 
<br>
<br>
• Achieve high availability and better fault tolerance for your applications – Elastic Load Balancing balances traffic across healthy targets in multiple Availability Zones. If one or more of your targets in a single Availability Zone are unhealthy, Elastic Load Balancing will route traffic to healthy targets in other Availability Zones. After the targets return to a healthy state, load balancing will automatically resume traffic to them.
<br>
• Automatically load balance your containerized applications – With enhanced container support for Elastic Load Balancing, you can now load balance across multiple ports on the same EC2 instance. You can also take advantage of deep integration with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), which provides a fully-managed container offering.
<br>
• Automatically scale your applications – Elastic Load Balancing works with Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to help you scale your applications to the demands of your customers. Amazon CloudWatch alarms can trigger auto scaling for your EC2 instance fleet when the latency of any one of your EC2 instances exceeds a preconfigured threshold.
<br>
• Use Elastic Load Balancing in your virtual private cloud (VPC) – You can use Elastic Load Balancing to create a public entry point into your VPC, or to route request traffic between tiers of your application within your VPC. You can assign security groups to your load balancer to control which ports are open to a list of allowed sources. Because Elastic Load Balancing works with your VPC, all your existing network access control lists (network ACLs) and routing tables continue to provide additional network controls. When you create a load balancer in your VPC, you can specify whether the load balancer is public (default) or internal.
<br>
• Enable hybrid load balancing – Elastic Load Balancing enables you to load balance across AWS and on-premises resources by using the same load balancer.
<br>
• Invoking Lambda functions over HTTP(S) – Elastic Load Balancing supports invoking Lambda functions to serve HTTP(S) requests. This enables users to access serverless applications from any HTTP client, including web browsers. You can register Lambda functions as targets and use the support for content-based routing rules in Application Load Balancers to route requests to different Lambda functions.


You can use the following features to monitor your load balancers, analyze traffic patterns, and troubleshoot issues with your load balancers and targets:
<br>
• Amazon CloudWatch metrics – Elastic Load Balancing publishes data points to Amazon CloudWatch for your load balancers and your targets. CloudWatch enables you to retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time series data, known as metrics. 
<br>
• Access logs – You can use access logs to capture detailed information about the requests that were made to your load balancer and store them as log files in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
<br>
• AWS CloudTrail logs – You can use AWS CloudTrail to capture detailed information about the calls that were made to the Elastic Load Balancing application programming interface (API) and store them as log files in Amazon S3. 

Key takeaways from this section include:
<br>
<br>
• Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple
targets (such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions) in one or more Availability Zones.
<br>
• Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, and Classic Load Balancer
<br>
• Elastic Load Balancing offers several monitoring tools for continuous monitoring and logging for auditing and analytics.

-**Amazon CloudWatch** 
<br>
To use AWS efficiently, you need insight into your AWS resources.

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that is built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SRE), and IT managers. CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources (and the applications that you run on AWS) in real time. 

You can create an alarm to monitor any Amazon CloudWatch metric in your account and use the alarm to automatically send a notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic or perform an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or Amazon EC2 action. 

You can also use Amazon CloudWatch Events to define rules that match incoming events (or changes in your AWS environment) and route them to targets for processing. Targets can include Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, Kinesis streams, Amazon ECS tasks, Step Functions state machines, Amazon SNS topics, Amazon SQS queues, and built-in targets.

With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health. There is no upfront commitment or minimum fee; you simply pay for what you use. You are charged at the end of the month for what you use.

You can create a CloudWatch alarm that watches a single CloudWatch metric or the result of a math expression based on CloudWatch metrics. You can create a CloudWatch alarm based on a static threshold, anomaly detection, or a metric math expression.

When you create an alarm based on a static threshold, you choose a CloudWatch metric for the alarm to watch and the threshold for that metric. The alarm goes to ALARM state when the metric breaches the threshold for a specified number of evaluation periods.

Key takeaways from this section: 
<br>
<br>
• Amazon CloudWatch helps you monitor your AWS resources—and the applications that you run on AWS—in real time.
• CloudWatch enables you to:
<br>
• Collect and track standard and custom metrics. 
<br>
• Set alarms to automatically send notifications to SNS topics or perform Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or Amazon EC2 actions based on the value of the metric or expression relative to a threshold over a number of time periods.
<br>
• Define rules that match changes in your AWS environment and route these events to targets for processing.
<br>
<br>
-**Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** 
<br>
Scaling is the ability to increase or decrease the compute capacity of your application. 

In the cloud, because computing power is a programmatic resource, you can take a flexible approach to scaling. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is an AWS service that helps you maintain application availability and enables you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to conditions you define. You can use the fleet management features of EC2 Auto Scaling to maintain the health and availability of your fleet.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling provides several ways to adjust scaling to best meet the needs of your applications. You can add or remove EC2 instances manually, on a schedule, in response to changing demand, or in combination with AWS Auto Scaling for predictive scaling. Dynamic scaling and predictive scaling can be used together to scale faster.

An Auto Scaling group is a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.

With Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, launching instances is referred to as scaling out, and terminating instances is referred to as scaling in.

To launch EC2 instances, an Auto Scaling group uses a launch configuration, which is an instance configuration template. You can think of a launch configuration as what you are scaling. When you create a launch configuration, you specify information for the instances. 

You define the minimum and maximum number of instances and desired capacity of your Auto Scaling group. Then, you launch it into a subnet within a VPC (you can think of this as where you are scaling). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling integrates with Elastic Load Balancing to enable you to attach one or more load balancers to an existing Auto Scaling group. After you attach the load balancer, it automatically registers the instances in the group and distributes incoming traffic across the instances.

Finally, you specify when you want the scaling event to occur. 

AWS Auto Scaling is a separate service that monitors your applications. It automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. 

Key takeaways from this section include: 
<br>
<br>
• Scaling enables you to respond quickly to changes in resource needs. 
<br>
• Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability, and enables you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to your workloads.
<br>
• An Auto Scaling group is a collection of EC2 instances. 
<br>
• A launch configuration is an instance configuration template. 
<br>
• You can implement dynamic scaling with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudWatch, and Elastic Load Balancing.

AWS Auto Scaling is a separate service that monitors your applications, and it automatically adjusts capacity for the following resources: 
<br>
• Amazon EC2 instances and Spot Fleets 
<br>
• Amazon ECS tasks 
<br>
• Amazon DynamoDB tables and indexes 
<br>
• Amazon Aurora Replicas
