## Blog Post 6



Class and thus our presentations were postponed a week due to the Saddle Ridge fire in Los Angeles. I took the opportunity to better familiarize myself with my presentation and to explore some of the tasks undertaken by my group partner. Specifically, I read more in detail about AWS EC2 Instance Connect and how to set it up. EC2 Instance Connect is only supported on AMIs Amazon Linux 2 (any version) and Ubuntu 16.04 or later. 

The first step to setting up Instance Connect is to configure SSH network access to your instance. That was completed by making that the security group associated with the instance allow inbound SSH traffic on port 22.

The next step is to Install EC2 Instance Connect on the Instance. The process for installing EC2 Instance Connect is different for instances launched using Amazon Linux 2 and Ubuntu. Our AMI is Ubuntu and the following instructions reflect that. To install EC2 Instance Connect use the command:

    $ ssh -i my_ec2_private_key.pem ubuntu@ec2-a-b-c-d.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

You then install the Instance Connect package on your instance with the command: 

    ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install ec2-instance-connect

An optional step, which our group undertook, is to install the EC2 Instance Connect CLI. The command to do that is:

    $ pip install ec2instanceconnectcli

Next you need to configure IAM Permissions for EC2 Instance Connect. For IAM users to connect, you must give them permission to push the public key to the instance. That is accomplished by creating a custom policy in JSON and attaching it to the user/group/role. Following is the policy document:

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey",
          "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/i-instanceID",
              "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/i-instanceID"
          ],
          "Condition": {
              "StringEquals": {
                  "ec2:osuser": "ami-username"
              }
          }
        },
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }

Use the create-policy command to create a new managed policy, and specify the JSON document that you created:

    $ aws iam create-policy --policy-name my-policy --policy-document file://JSON-file-name

Then, use the attach-user-policy command to attach the managed policy to the specified IAM user:

    $ aws iam attach-user-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::account-id:policy/my-policy --user-name IAM-friendly-name

Finally, you can configure the AWS CLI using the command:

    $ aws configure
