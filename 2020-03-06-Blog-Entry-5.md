## Blog Post 5

In class on Saturday, February 29 2020, the class conducted group project presentations. One of the next things that our group will be focusing on is completing the project documentation.

### AWS Academy  Cloud Foundations Module 3: AWS Global Infrastructure Overview

#### Topics

-**AWS Clobal Infrastructure**. Designed to deliver a flexible, reliable, scalable, and secure cloud computing environment with high-quality global network performance. An AWS Region is a geographical area. Data replication across Regions is controlled by the customer. Communication between Regions uses AWS backbone network infrastructure. A Region provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network, as well as consisting of two or more Availability Zones. An availability zone consists of one or more data centers. Determine the right Region for your services, applications, and data based on data governance, legal requirements, proximity to customers (latency), services available within a region, and costs that can vary by Region. Each Availability Zone is a fully isolated partition of the AWS infrastructure. Availability Zone consist of discrete data centers. It is recommended to replicate data and resouces across Availability Zones for resiliency. AWS data centers are designed for security. AWS infrastrucure is elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available. 
<br>
<br>
-**AWS Services & Service Categories**. AWS global infrastructure can be broken down into three elements: regions, availability zones, and points of presence (includes edge locations). This provides the platform for a broad range of services. There are 23 product or service categories. Most widely used services: AWS storage service (Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, Amazon EFS, Amazon Simple Storage Service Glacier), AWS compute services (Amazon EC2, Amazon EC2 Auto Sacling, Amazon ECS, Amazon ECR, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, Amazon EKS, AWS Fargate), AWS Database services (Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB), AWS networking and content delivery services (Amazon VPC, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Transit Gateway, Amazon Route 53, AWS Direct Connect, AWS VPN), AWS security identity and compliance services (IAM, AWS Organizations, Amazon Cognito, AWS Artifact, AWS Key Management Service, AWS Shield), AWS cost management services (AWS Cost and Usage Report, AWS Budgets, AWS Cost Explorer), and AWS management and governance services (Management Console, Config, Amazon CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, CLI, Trusted Advisor, Well-Architected Tool, CloudTrail).

### Lab 3: Introduction to Amazon EC2

Lab 3 was an overview of launching, resizing, managing, and monitoring an Amazon EC2 instance. Amazon EC2 allows you to pay only for capacity that you actually use.

#### Topics

-Launch a web server with termination protection enabled
<br>
-Monitor Your EC2 instance
<br>
-Modify the security group that your web server is using to allow HTTP access
<br>
-Resize your Amazon EC2 instance to scale
<br>
-Explore EC2 limits
<br>
-Test termination protection
<br>
-Terminate your EC2 instance

#### Tasks

1. Launch Your Amazon EC2 Instance
<br>
-Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance, which is a virtual server in the cloud.
<br>
-Choose an Instance Type. Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications.
<br>
-Configure Instance Details. Configure the instance to suit your requirements. This includes networking and monitoring settings.
<br>
-Add Storage. Amazon EC2 stores data on a network-attached virtual disk called Elastic Block Store.
<br>
-Add Tags. Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. 
<br>
-Configure Security Group. A security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. 
<br>
-Review Instance Launch. The Review page displays the configuration for the instance you are about to launch.
<br>
2. Monitor Your Instance
<br>
-Amazon EC2 performs automated checks on every running EC2 instance to identify hardware and software issues. This monitoring tab displays Amazon CloudWatch metrics for your instance. The System Log displays the console output of the instance, which is a valuable tool for problem diagnosis. If you are unable to reach your instance via SSH or RDP, you can capture a screenshot of your instance and view it as an image. 
<br>
3. Update Your Security Group and Access the Web Server
<br>
-You are not currently able to access your web server because the security group is not permitting inbound traffic on port 80, which is used for HTTP web requests. This is a demonstration of using a security group as a firewall to restrict the network traffic that is allowed in and out of an instance. To correct this, you update the security group to permit web traffic on port 80.
<br>
4. Resisze Your Instance: Instance Type and EBS Volume
<br>
-Before you can resize an instance, you must stop it. In the Actions menu, select Instance Settings, Change Instance Type, then change the configuration. In the left navigation menu, click Volumes. In the Actions  menu, select Modify Volume. In left navigation pane, click Instances. In the Actions  menu, select Instance State  Start.
<br>
5. Explore EC2 Limits
<br>
-In the left navigation pane, click Limits.
<br>
6. Test Termination Protection
<br>
-You can delete your instance when you no longer need it. This is referred to as terminating your instance. You cannot connect to or restart an instance after it has been terminated.

### Activity: AWS Lambda

For this activity we created an AWS Lambda function. We also created an Amazon CloudWatch event to trigger the function every minute. The function uses an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. This IAM role allows the function to stop an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that is running in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

#### Tasks

1. Create a Lambda function. In the AWS Management Console, from the Services menu, choose Lambda. Click Create function.
<br>
2. Configure the trigger. Configure a scheduled event to trigger the Lambda function by setting a CloudWatch event as the event source (or trigger).
<br>
3. Configure the Lambda function. Paste a few lines of code to update two values in the function code.
<br>
4. Verify that the Lambda function worked. See if your instance was stopped.
