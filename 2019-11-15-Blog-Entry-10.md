## Blog Post 10



This week my team put the finishing touches on Project 1. We completed the project [documentation](https://github.com/alexcoward/Project1/wiki), deployed our Fail2ban Ansible playbook into the production environment by incorporating it into a [playbook](https://github.com/alexcoward/Project1Infrastructure/blob/master/ansible/setup_all.yml) that configures our web servers and deploys the web application, and my teammate wrote a [script](https://github.com/alexcoward/Project1Infrastructure/blob/master/ansible/execute_playbook.sh) that invokes the Ansible playbook on our bastion host. Typically configuration of the web servers and deployment of the web application can be done by using [SSH agent forwarding](https://medium.com/@praneeth1691/running-ansible-with-ssh-agent-forwarding-957bcb14c95c) via a bastion host or in Ansible 2 done [natively](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#how-do-i-configure-a-jump-host-to-access-servers-that-i-have-no-direct-access-to) in Ansible. 

One of the requirements for Project 1 was to never enter secrets into our Terraform configuration files directly. Starting with Project 0, my teammate and I elected to use AWS Instance Connect to avoid having to deal with any SSH keys. This presented an issue when we realized that for Project 1, the Ansible playbook(s) would have to be run locally to configure two web servers located in private subnets that are accessed by a bastion instance. 

**SOLUTION**

There is a [command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2-instance-connect/send-ssh-public-key.html) that can push an SSH public key, from a generated key pair, to a given EC2 instance for 60 seconds. That means we have 60 seconds to SSH into the servers and execute our playbook.

    ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -f my_rsa_key -N '' >/dev/null
    
    aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key
    
From the code above to generate the key pair, -q means silence, -t is for the type of key, -f is the filename of the key file, -N is the passphrase which is blank, and >/dev/null refers to the null device which discards input. 

Though invoked locally, the playbook is executed on the bastion so the configuration files must be located there. We can accomplish that by cloning the repository.  

    git clone https://github.com/alexcoward/Project1Infrastructure.git
    
To execute the script on the remote bastion we used mssh to connect. Then we used bash -s to redirect the script to standard input on the bash shell on the bastion.

    mssh ubuntu@[aws-EC2-id] "bash -s" < /pathToScript

This week I also took the opportunity to start learning a little bit about CISCO routing and networking. Some basic router commands I learned:

    Router(config)#enable
    
Enter global configuration mode.

    Router(config)#banner motd #
    
Apply a banner. This is used to give a small security notice to the user who wants to access the router.

    Router(config)#enable secret

Enables a secret password to secure privilege mode. It will override the enable password if both passwords are set.
