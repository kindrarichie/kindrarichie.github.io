## Blog Post 5



This week and the last week we worked on our first project assignment. The project tasks are to:

  * Select a group leader
  * Purchase a domain
  * Setup AWS VPC
  * Setup a Web Server on AWS EC2
  * Setup the domain using AWS Route53 
  * Generate TLS Certificates
  * Create an Ansible Playbook that can install a web server generate a generic webpage with our team names and team members
  * Create an AWS diagram showing all of our infrastructure 
  * Document our work


My teammate is the group leader for this assignment. My individual tasks are to:

- Setup AWS VPC
- Generate the webpage
- Create the service diagram
- Aid in documentation 
- Aid in creating the presentation 

One of the first tasks was to create a virtual private cloud and break our given subnet into public and private subnetworks to allow services in AWS to function properly. AWS does provide a VPC wizard, but I wanted to create the VPC manually so that I could understand each part. I chose the block 172.31.0.0/16. Then I broke the network down into subnets. I read an article about best practices for AWS VPC configurations. It suggested to plan your CIDR block carefully and go a little bit bigger than you think you need. I chose subnets with size /19 IPv4 CIDR blocks. This provides 8190 IPv4 addresses per subnet. The VPC uses 3 availability zones to eliminate single points of failure. There is a custom route table associated with the public subnet. It enables instances in the subnet to communicate with other instances in the VPC over IPv4, and instances in the subnet to communicate directly with the Internet over IPv4 via the internet gateway. There is the main route table associated with the private subnet that also allows instances in the subnet to communicate with other instances in the VPC over IPv4. There is also a set of DHCP options. domain-name-servers=AmazonProvidedDNS for instances that need to communicate over the VPC's Internet gateway. domain-name=us-west-2.compute.internal for communication between instances in the same network. The security group for the VPC allows HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH inbound access. All traffic is allowed via the outbound rule.

Regarding access to the EC2 instance, we needed to think of a secure way to allow users to access the machine while not sharing credentials. Sharing credentials leads to loss of access control, improper credential storage, and an inability to perform event attribution. Thatâ€™s where AWS IAM comes in. It enables managed access to AWS services and resources. You can create users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny their access to resources. The solution to providing SSH access without the use of passwords was to use EC2 instance connect. Amazon EC2 Instance Connect provides a simple and secure way to connect to your instances using Secure Shell (SSH). With Instance Connect, you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and principals to control SSH access to your instances. It removes the need to share and manage SSH keys by connecting using a one-time disposable SSH key You can use Instance Connect to connect to your instance using a browser-based client, the Amazon EC2 Instance Connect CLI, or the SSH client of your choice.

I recreated all the steps that my teammate undertook on my own AWS account. When I attempted to connect via mssh after using AWS configure I kept getting an error that the instance was not recognized. I learned that the AWS CLI can have more than one profile and that to change the default profile you have to update the credentials file. To create a new profile for AWS, configure the command is:

    $ aws configure --profile produser


This week I became more comfortable using the AWS CLI.
