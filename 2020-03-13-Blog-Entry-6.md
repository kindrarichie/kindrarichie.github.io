### AWS Module 4: Cloud Security

#### Topics

-**AWS Shared Responsibility Model** Security and compliance are a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. The differentiation of who is responsible for what is commonly referred to as security “of” the cloud versus security “in” the cloud. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. The global infrastructure includes AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations. The customer is responsible for the encryption of data at rest and data in transit. The customer is responsible for what is implemented by using AWS services and for the applications that are connected to AWS. Customers retain control of what security they choose to implement to protect their own data, environment, applications, IAM configurations, and operating systems.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to services that provide basic building blocks for cloud IT, typically including access to configure networking, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Amazon EC2—can be categorized as IaaS and thus require the customer to perform all necessary security configuration and management tasks. 

Platform as a service (PaaS) refers to services that remove the need for the customer to manage the underlying infrastructure (hardware, operating systems, etc.). AWS Lambda and Amazon RDS can be categorized as PaaS because AWS operates the infrastructure layer, the operating system, and platforms. These service act more like managed services, with AWS handling a larger portion of the security requirements. 

Software as a service (SaaS) refers to services that provide centrally hosted software that is typically accessible via a web browser, mobile app, or application programming interface (API). The licensing model for SaaS offerings is typically subscription or pay as you go. Some AWS services—such as AWS Trusted Advisor, AWS Shield, and Amazon Chime—could be categorized as SaaS offerings, given their characteristics.

-**AWS IAM** It allows you to control access to compute, storage, database, and application services in the AWS Cloud. With IAM, you can manage which resources can be accessed by who, and how these resources can be accessed. IAM is a feature of your AWS account, and it is offered at no additional charge. 
An IAM user is a person or application that is defined in an AWS account, and that must make API calls to AWS products. 
An IAM group is a collection of IAM users. You can use IAM groups to simplify specifying and managing permissions for multiple users. 
An IAM policy is a document that defines permissions to determine what users can do in the AWS account.  All policies are evaluated, and the result is always that the request is either allowed or denied. When there is a conflict, the most restrictive policy applies. There are two types of IAM policies. Identity-based policies are permissions policies that you can attach to a principal (or identity) such as an IAM user, role, or group. Identity-based policies can be further categorized as: 1 Managed policies, standalone identity-based policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. 2 Inline policies, policies that you create and manage, and that are embedded directly into a single user group or role.
Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource, such as an S3 bucket. 
An IAM role is a tool for granting temporary access to specific AWS resources in an AWS account.
a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that do not normally have access to your AWS resources.
Authentication is a basic computer security concept: a user or system must first prove their identity. You can assign two different types of access to users: programmatic access and AWS Management Console access. With MFA, users and systems must provide an MFA token—in addition to the regular sign-in credentials—before they can access AWS services and resources.

Authorization is the process of determining what permissions a user, service or application should be granted. 

The principle of least privilege promotes that you grant only the minimal user privileges needed to the user, based on the needs of your users. When you create IAM policies, it is a best practice to follow this security advice of granting least privilege. 

Note that the scope of the IAM service configurations is global. The settings are not defined at an AWS Region level. IAM settings apply across all AWS Regions.
<br>

-**AWS Securing a New AWS Account** AWS account root user is a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account.  It is accessed by signing into the AWS Management Console with the email address and password that you used to create the account.  To stop using the account root user, [creating your first IAM admin user and group.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) Another recommended step for securing a new AWS account is to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the account root user login and for all other IAM user logins. AWS CloudTrail is a service that logs all API requests to resources in your account. In this way, it enables operational auditing on your account. An additional recommended step for securing a new AWS account is to enable billing reports, such as the AWS Cost and Usage Report. 

The best practice recommendations include:
-Secure logins with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
<br>
-Delete account root user access keys.
<br>
Create individual IAM users and grant permissions according to the principle of least privilege.
<br>
-Use groups to assign permissions to IAM users.
<br>
-Configure a strong password policy.
<br>
-Delegate using roles instead of sharing credentials.
<br>
-Monitor account activity using AWS CloudTrail.
<br>
<br>
-**Securing Accounts** AWS Organizations is an account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. One helpful security feature is that you can group accounts into organizational units (OUs) and attach different access policies to each OU. AWS Organizations integrates with and supports IAM. AWS Organizations expands that control to the account level by giving you control over what users and roles in an account or a group of accounts can do. AWS Organizations provides service control policies (SCPs) that enable you to specify the maximum permissions that member accounts in the organization can have. These restrictions even override the administrators of member accounts. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a service that enables you to create and manage encryption keys, and to control the use of encryption across a wide range of AWS services and your applications. Customer master keys (CMKs) are used to control access to data encryption keys that encrypt and decrypt your data. Amazon Cognito provides solutions to control access to AWS resources from your application. You can define roles and map users to different roles so your application can access only the resources that are authorized for each user.
Amazon Cognito uses common identity management standards, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0. Amazon Cognito helps you meet multiple security and compliance requirements. AWS Shield is a managed distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications that run on AWS. AWS Shield Standard is automatically enabled to all AWS customers at no additional cost. AWS Shield Advanced is an optional paid service.

-**Securing data on AWS** Data encryption is an essential tool to use when your objective is to protect digital data. Data encryption takes data that is legible and encodes it so that it is unreadable to anyone who does not have access to the secret key that can be used to decode it.
Data at rest refers to data that is physically stored on disk or on tape. You can create encrypted file systems on AWS so that all your data and metadata is encrypted at rest by using the open standard Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-256 encryption algorithm. Data in transit refers to data that is moving across the network. Encryption of data in transit is accomplished by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 with an open standard AES-256 cipher. TLS was formerly called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). AWS Certificate Manager is a service that enables you to provision, manage, and deploy SSL or TLS certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources. AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that provides on-premises access to AWS Cloud storage. By default, all Amazon S3 buckets are private and can be accessed only by users who are explicitly granted access. AWS provides  tools and options for controlling access to your S3 buckets including: using Amazon S3 Block Public Access, writing IAM policies that specify the users or roles that can access specific buckets and objects, writing bucket policies that define access to specific buckets or objects, setting access control lists (ACLs) on your buckets and objects, AWS Trusted Advisor to provide a bucket permission check feature that is a useful tool for discovering if any of the buckets in your account have permissions that grant global access.

AWS engages with external certifying bodies and independent auditors to provide customers with information about the policies, processes, and controls that are established and operated by AWS. AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. AWS Config is a Regional service. To track resources across Regions, enable it in every Region that you use. AWS Artifact provides on-demand downloads of AWS security and compliance documents. You can also use AWS Artifact to review, accept, and track the status of AWS agreements such as the Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

### Lab 4: Working with EBS

The focus of Lab 4 is on [Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/?ebs-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ebs-whats-new.sort-order=desc). Amazon EBS offers persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EBS volumes are network-attached and persist independently from the life of an instance. Amazon EBS volumes can be leveraged as an Amazon EC2 instances boot partition or attached to a running Amazon EC2 instance as a standard block device. As a boot partition, Amazon EC2 instances can be stopped and restarted, enabling you to pay only for the storage resources used while maintaining your instance's state. Amazon EBS can create point-in-time consistent snapshots of your volumes that are then stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones. 

#### Topics

-Create an Amazon EBS volume
<br>
-Attach and mount volume to an EC2 instance
<br>

<br>
-Create an ext3 file system on the new volume: sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdf
<br>
-Create a directory for mounting the new storage volume: sudo mkdir /mnt/data-store
<br>
-Mount the new volume: sudo mount /dev/sdf /mnt/data-store
<br>
-Configure the instance to mount the volume whenever the instance is started by modifying
/etc/fstab: echo "/dev/sdf   /mnt/data-store ext3 defaults,noatime 1 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
<br>
-Create a file with text on the mounted volume: sudo sh -c "echo some text has been written > /mnt/data-store/file.txt"
<br>

### Lab 5: Build a DB Server and Interact Using an App

For this activity we focused on the concept of leveraging an AWS-managed database instance for solving relational database needs. [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/faqs/) will set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. We configured and launched a Multi-AZ Amazon RDS for MySQL database instance. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). There are six familiar database engines to choose from: Amazon Aurora, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB.

#### Topics

-Launching an Amazon RDS DB instance with high availability
<br>
-Configuring the DB instance to permit connections from your web server
<br>
-Opening a web application and interact with your database

#### Tasks

**Create a security group for the RDS DB Instance**
<br>
-In the AWS Management Console, on the Services menu, click VPC.
<br>
-Click Create security group and then configure.
<br>
-Add a rule to the security group to permit inbound database requests. Click Edit rules. Click Add
Rule then configure:
Type: MySQL/Aurora (3306)
CIDR, IP, Security Group or Prefix List: Type sg and then select Web Security Group.
This configures the Database security group to permit inbound traffic on port 3306 from any EC2
instance that is associated with the Web Security Group.
<br>
**Create a DB Subnet Group** 
<br>
-On the Services  menu, click RDS.
<br>
-In the left navigation pane, click Subnet groups.
<br>
-Click Create DB Subnet Group and then configure.
<br>
**Create an Amazon RDS DB Instance**
<br>
-In the left navigation pane, click Databases.
<br>
-Click Create database and select MySQL and configure.
<br>
**Interact with Your Database**
<br>
-Get the WebServer IP address.
<br>
-Open a new web browser tab, paste the WebServer IP address and press Enter.
<br>
-Configure the application to connect to your database.
<br>
-Test the web application by adding, editing and removing contacts.
