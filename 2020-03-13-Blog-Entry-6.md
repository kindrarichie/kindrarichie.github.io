### AWS Module 3: AWS Global Infrastructure Overview

#### Topics

-**AWS Global Infrastructure**. Designed to deliver a flexible, reliable, scalable, and secure cloud computing environment with high-quality global network performance. An AWS Region is a geographical area. Data replication across Regions is controlled by the customer. Communication between Regions uses AWS backbone network infrastructure. A Region provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network, as well as consisting of two or more Availability Zones. An availability zone consists of one or more data centers. Determine the right Region for your services, applications, and data based on data governance, legal requirements, proximity to customers (latency), services available within a region, and costs that can vary by Region. Each Availability Zone is a fully isolated partition of the AWS infrastructure. Availability Zone consist of discrete data centers. It is recommended to replicate data and resources across Availability Zones for resiliency. AWS data centers are designed for security. AWS infrastructure is elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available. 
<br>
<br>
-**AWS Services & Service Categories**. AWS global infrastructure can be broken down into three elements: regions, availability zones, and points of presence (includes edge locations). This provides the platform for a broad range of services. There are 23 product or service categories. Most widely used services: AWS storage service (Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, Amazon EFS, Amazon Simple Storage Service Glacier), AWS compute services (Amazon EC2, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, Amazon ECS, Amazon ECR, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, Amazon EKS, AWS Fargate), AWS Database services (Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB), AWS networking and content delivery services (Amazon VPC, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Transit Gateway, Amazon Route 53, AWS Direct Connect, AWS VPN), AWS security identity and compliance services (IAM, AWS Organizations, Amazon Cognito, AWS Artifact, AWS Key Management Service, AWS Shield), AWS cost management services (AWS Cost and Usage Report, AWS Budgets, AWS Cost Explorer), and AWS management and governance services (Management Console, Config, Amazon CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, CLI, Trusted Advisor, Well-Architected Tool, CloudTrail).

### Lab 4: Working with EBS

The focus of Lab 4 is on [Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/?ebs-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ebs-whats-new.sort-order=desc). Amazon EBS offers persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EBS volumes are network-attached and persist independently from the life of an instance. Amazon EBS volumes can be leveraged as an Amazon EC2 instances boot partition or attached to a running Amazon EC2 instance as a standard block device. As a boot partition, Amazon EC2 instances can be stopped and restarted, enabling you to pay only for the storage resources used while maintaining your instance's state. Amazon EBS can create point-in-time consistent snapshots of your volumes that are then stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones. 

#### Topics

-Create an Amazon EBS volume
<br>
-Attach and mount volume to an EC2 instance
<br>
-Create a snapshot of the volume
<br>
-Create a new volume from the snapshot 
<br>
-Attach and mount the new volume to your EC2 instance

#### Tasks

**Create a New EBS Volume**
<br>
-In the AWS Management Console, on the Services menu, click EC2.
<br>
-In the left navigation pane, click Volumes.
<br>
-Click Create Volume.
<br>
**Attach the Volume to an Instance**
<br>
-Select My Volume.
<br>
-Click Attach Volume.
<br>
**Connect to Your Amazon EC2 Instance**
<br>
-Download the pem file.
<br>
-Change the file permissioms.
<br>
-Use ssh to connect.
<br>
**Create and Configure Your File System**
<br>
-View the storage available on your instance: df -h
<br>
-Create an ext3 file system on the new volume: sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdf
<br>
-Create a directory for mounting the new storage volume: sudo mkdir /mnt/data-store
<br>
-Mount the new volume: sudo mount /dev/sdf /mnt/data-store
<br>
-Configure the instance to mount the volume whenever the instance is started by modifying
/etc/fstab: echo "/dev/sdf   /mnt/data-store ext3 defaults,noatime 1 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
<br>
-Create a file with text on the mounted volume: sudo sh -c "echo some text has been written > /mnt/data-store/file.txt"
<br>
**Create an Amazon EBS Snapshot**
<br>
-In the AWS Management Console, click on Volumes and select the volume.
<br>
-In the Actions menu, click Create Snapshot.
<br>
**Restore the Amazon EBS Snapshot**
<br>
-In the AWS Management Console, select  My Snapshot.
<br>
-In the Actions menu, click Create Volume.
<br>
-Attach the restored volume to the EC2 instance
<br>
-Mount the restored volume
<br>
<br>

### Lab 5: Build a DB Server and Interact Using an App

For this activity we focused on the concept of leveraging an AWS-managed database instance for solving relational database needs. [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/faqs/) will set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. We configured and launched a Multi-AZ Amazon RDS for MySQL database instance. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). There are six familiar database engines to choose from: Amazon Aurora, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB.

#### Topics

-Launching an Amazon RDS DB instance with high availability
<br>
-Configuring the DB instance to permit connections from your web server
<br>
-Opening a web application and interact with your database

#### Tasks

**Create a security group for the RDS DB Instance**
<br>
-In the AWS Management Console, on the Services menu, click VPC.
<br>
-Click Create security group and then configure.
<br>
-Add a rule to the security group to permit inbound database requests. Click Edit rules. Click Add
Rule then configure:
Type: MySQL/Aurora (3306)
CIDR, IP, Security Group or Prefix List: Type sg and then select Web Security Group.
This configures the Database security group to permit inbound traffic on port 3306 from any EC2
instance that is associated with the Web Security Group.
<br>
**Create a DB Subnet Group** 
<br>
-On the Services  menu, click RDS.
<br>
-In the left navigation pane, click Subnet groups.
<br>
-Click Create DB Subnet Group and then configure.
<br>
**Create an Amazon RDS DB Instance**
<br>
-In the left navigation pane, click Databases.
<br>
-Click Create database and select MySQL and configure.
<br>
**Interact with Your Database**
<br>
-Get the WebServer IP address.
<br>
-Open a new web browser tab, paste the WebServer IP address and press Enter.
<br>
-Configure the application to connect to your database.
<br>
-Test the web application by adding, editing and removing contacts.
